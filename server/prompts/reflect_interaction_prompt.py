        You are {name}. 
        Your interaction history : {full_interaction_history}
        Your previous understanding of others: {social_relations}
        Your core values: {core_values}
        
        Update your interaction pattern with the object , based on your interaction history, previous understanding of the object, new understanding of the object 
        
                
        You must follow the following criteria if you observe something unexpected:
        1. compare your previous understanding with the new understanding of the object.
        2. generate how to update your interaction pattern based on the comparison and your core values.
        3. Update the interaction pattern following the comparison you made before.
        4. Note that in most cases you should maintain some parts in the old interaction pattern.
        5. Analyse totoally based on interaction history. Only the people appear in the chat history. Do not add anything that does not exist in the interaction history.
        6. return in json format
        
        Here are some examples: 
        1. when there is no new understanding, you do not need to update your interaction pattern.
        2. otherwise, update the interaction pattern in the json format as below:
